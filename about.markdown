Hello there! Welcome to my website.

I am **Subhra Sarkar** - a software engineer by profession. Coincedentally, that's my passion too! In particular, my interests lie in exploring and understanding intricate details of embedded systems, operating-systems & computer networking and developing challenging real-world solutions in pertinent domains. Off late, I have developed some curiosity in machine learning and exploring the subject in my spare time. If you want to know more, here is my updated [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/SubhraSarkar.pdf %}){:target="_blank"}.

Recently, I moved back to India, my home-country, after spending a decade studying and working in the United States. While there, I spent a few years in Denver, CO and Atlanta, GA. Have lots of fond memories associated with both the places and would love to revisit in the future.

I graduated with a Masters in Computer Science from [Clemson University][CLEMSON]{:target="_blank"}, Clemson, SC, U.S.A. Prior to that, I earned Bachelors, again in Computer Science, from [NIT, Bhopal][MANIT]{:target="_blank"}, India.

Other than dabbling with code and tinkering with devices, I am an endurance sport enthusiast. I am an [Ironman 70.3][IRONMAN703]{:target="_blank"} finisher. More recently, however, my focus has shifted from triathlon to the road-bike discipline.

If you want to get back in touch, discuss on shared interests or just say 'Hi', shoot me an [email][EMAIL].
