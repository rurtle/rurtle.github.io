Welcome to my personal website. I am **Subhra Sarkar** - a software engineer by profession. Coincedentally, that's my passion too. I love to build things. In particular, my interest lies in embedded systems, operating systems, networking - loosly near the layers where hardware interfaces with the software stack or around `Hardware Abstraction Layer` (`HAL`). More recently, I have developed an interest in machine learning and trying to devote some time in learning this area.

If you have not figued it out already, I am an avid open-source enthusiast. Because of my previous employment restrictions, I have not been able to contribute to OSS projects. Hoping that should change in the future as more companies are embracing and contributing to open-source projects these days. If you have an interesting OSS project, I would love to know about it.

Apart from dabbling with code, computers and embedded devices, I am an occassional [endurance sport junkie][Strava]. I finished [Ironman 70.3 Miami, FL][IM70.3Miami-2015] in 2015. I moved to Denver, CO in 2016 and while there, my focus shifted from triathlon to the road-bike discipline. I also developed a keen interest in the professional bike racing events during this time - Vuelta, Giro and TDF in particular. Being an engineer, I like to quantify things and my [Garmin 920XT][Garmin920XT] has served me really well over the years.

If you want to get back in touch, discuss on shared interests or just say 'hi', shoot me an [email][email].
